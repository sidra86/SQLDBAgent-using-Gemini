"""
⚠️ DANGEROUS SQL Agent Demo - ALLOWS ANY SQL INCLUDING DELETE ⚠️

This script demonstrates a DANGEROUS implementation of a SQL agent that executes
ANY SQL command without restrictions, including destructive operations like DELETE, DROP, etc.

This is intentionally risky code used to show what NOT to do in production.

Key Security Issues Demonstrated:
- No input validation or sanitization
- Allows DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE, ALTER operations
- No user permissions or access controls
- Direct SQL execution without safety checks
- Automatic transaction commits

Educational Purpose: Shows the difference between unrestricted and safe SQL agents.
NEVER use this pattern in production environments!
